    Objective:

Demonstrate how to log information to the browser's console using JavaScript. You will set up your development environment, create and link JavaScript and HTML files, write JavaScript code to log a message, and test the output in a web browser.

Instructions:

1.    Create a new folder for your files.
2.    Create a new JavaScript file (with the .js file extension)
3.    Save your JavaScript file to the new folder.
4.    Create a new HTML file and use the <script> tags to link the JavaScript file to this HTML file.
5.    Save the HTML file to the new folder.
6.    Use the console.log() method to log out a message to the console.
7.    Open your HTML file in a web browser and open the console of the web browser to check if your output is correct.


Once you have completed the instructions in this activity and have achieved the desired output, you can then add your code to your own GitHub repository to showcase your JavaScript skills. You may also see an example of how we achieved this mini project at our GitHub repository below.
